# Noise_Cancellation_System
This project implements a Noise Cancellation System using Verilog, simulating the filtering of noise from input signals through a combination of IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) Filter, LMS (Least Mean Squares) Adaptive Filter, and a simple Finite State Machine (FSM) for system control. The design is fully verified using testbenches and simulated on EDA Playground.
